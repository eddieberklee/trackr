# trackr

(Name will be changed eventually, to something better)

What's the Idea?

It's an App for:
 * tracking your BAC (don't get too drunk bro)
 * remembering what you've drank (build up a list of all the drinks you've ever had)
 * being able to join a group (see how drunk all your friends are)

 Individual
 As an individual I can log what I drink and when (title of drink, editable timestamp of drink entry).
 I like to log whenever I grab a new drink.

 Group
 As a group of people we like to share with each other what we drink and how much we drink.
 I like to share updates with my friends when I am drinking something new.

Check out *Issues* for tickets to work on.

The folder *design* is for the specs/designs of the different screens. As of now, they'll just be pictures of sketches on paper ;P

Using ActiveAndroid as the Database ORM (ORM = easier and more abstracted way to deal with database stuff)
